These are some of the projects to which I have contributed:

  - **SpecFlow** ([techtalk/SpecFlow](https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow)) - SpecFlow is a pragmatic BDD solution for .NET. It uses the Gherkin specification language and integrates to many development tools.

  - **SquishIt** ([jetheredge/SquishIt](https://github.com/jetheredge/SquishIt)) - SquishIt is an asset optimization library for .net web applications. It handles combining and minifying css and javascript assets through creation of bundles.

  - **DotLiquid** ([formosatek/dotliquid](https://github.com/formosatek/dotliquid)) - DotLiquid is a .NET 3.5 port of the popular Ruby Liquid templating language. It is a separate project that aims to retain the same template syntax as the original, while using .NET coding conventions where possible.

And these are some of my own humble ones:

  - **NuGet Content Generator** ([rdumont/NuGetContentGenerator](https://github.com/rdumont/NuGetContentGenerator)) - This tool helps you in creating NuGet packages by automating the process of converting *.cs into *.cs.pp files. In the process, it creates the desired replacement tokens that can be used by NuGet when adding content files.

  - **Dately** ([rdumont/Dately](https://github.com/rdumont/Dately)) - A .NET library for parsing and writing dates as text
