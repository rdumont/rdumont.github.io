My name is **Rodrigo Dumont** and I'm a software engineer who lives in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I currently work at [VTEX](http://www.vtex.com.br "VTEX e-Commerce Cloud Application"), the leading e-commerce technology company in Latin America, as a developer.

While coding mostly in **C#** for the web, I also write a fair amount of **JavaScript** / **CoffeeScript**, and sometimes play around with other languages. My tools of the trade are **Visual Studio**, **Git** and Sublime Text.

Although never having gone deep into it, I've had my adventures as an **entrepeneur** and **startupper**. But for now my efforts are put into the **software development community**. You can see some of my **[open source projects](/projects/)** and, if ever in need of an extra hand (or head), just ask!
